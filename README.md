# WineQualityPredictionApp: https://vinylbr-winequalitypredictionapp-app-f9qbpz.streamlit.app/
## Overview of the project
1. Deploy trained ML model that predicts the quality of red and white wine
2. Ensure usability for user who may be unfamiliar to jargon associated with features
3. Allow the user to explore model predictions for different values of features using interactive elements like sliders

## Python Packages Used:
1. streamlit
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. sckit-learn
5. matplotlib.pyplot

## Data:
Wine quality data used from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality

## Future Work:
A cleaner way to execute multi-page streamlit apps.
